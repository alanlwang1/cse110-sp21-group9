### V. **Conflict Resolution**
1. **What should we do if a team member is *not* meeting deadlines?**
- Talk with the team member first to figure out why the team member is not meeting deadlines, if the team member is not cooperative we will just report the situation to a staff member.
2. **What should we do if there is a disagreement?**
- Take a vote on what approach to take or suggest something else that the team can agree on. If this cannot be settled through team voting/suggestions, the team leader may settle this.
3. **How should we handle conflict in positions, strategies or opinions?**
- We initially decide what we want and our team can vote on what the best course of action is. If there are conflicts in positions, the team leader can settle this by assigning a position to the team member instead.

- If something is taking too long to resolve we will have a team lead decide the best course of action for the team.
