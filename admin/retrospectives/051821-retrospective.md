# Retrospective 1

**Date:** 5/18/2021

**Information compiled by:** Daisuke, Elisa, Etienne

As stated in the assignment writeup, retrospectives are integral to the Agile process as it allows us as a team to reflect and identify our strengths and weaknesses after a sprint. The following retrospectives were designed to identify said strengths and weaknesses for our group, Team 9: The Powellmon.

## Team Values

This retrospective asked all members their thoughts on how well we as a team had lived up to the team values we had listed in our team page. 

**Results:**

As can be seen, there was a general consensus that we did well in maintaining integrity and pursuing knowledge and did alright in working smarter rather than harder. Some members thought we did problem solving, collaboration, user-centered thinking, and openness well while others thought we didn’t do so well in these categories. 

Upon asking members of our team their thoughts about the given results, not much input was given. We believe this is due to the fact that this retrospective only captured the symptoms, both good and bad of our team's efforts. As such, we designed this second retrospective test to further analyze our progress as a team.

## Agile Efficiency

This retrospective asked all members their thoughts on how efficiently or well we as a team had done different aspects of the Agile process. This is not a rating on how effective we think these processes are in general, rather, it is a rating on how effective we as a team have been at carrying out these processes. This retro was created in the interest of making these Agile processes get done more efficiently/effectively.

As can be seen, there was a general consensus that we did well in how we conducted our meetings, how we divided up work and our team allocations. We also agreed that there was miscommunication which affected our sprint negatively in the beginning. We were unsure about specifics for certain features we were trying to implement and this led to tech debt and our inability to get as far as we wanted to in this sprint. 

To address these issues, we set up another retrospective to talk about what specifically we were doing right and wrong regarding these Agile practices. After collecting everyone’s responses, we talked about what we could do to reinforce the rights and correct the wrongs and came up with these action items.

**Action Items:**



*   We should look ahead maybe a bit more and communicate deadlines clearly
*   Make sure there isn’t any app-breaking code in pipeline every 2-3 days
*   We should have a clear index/glossary for files/functions/variables/etc to explain what it does and how it interacts with the rest of the app
*   More meetings (daily meetings)
*   More slack participation
*   We should specify our goals more clearly
*   We should have a semi-regular review of what we initially planned on and what we’ve actually accomplished.
*   Write a sparknotes of what you’ve done in coding meetings on slack.
