## Team Values

This retrospective asked all members their thoughts on how well we as a team had lived up to the team values we had listed in our team page. 

**Results:**

As can be seen, there was a general consensus that we have improved things like problem solving and team collaboration. In the previous retrospective, problem solving and team collaboration were both one of our weak points as a team. Additionally, it is important to note that while some members thought we did problem solving, collaboration, user-centered thinking, and openness well, others still disagreed and thought we didn’t do so well in these categories. 

## Agile Efficiency

This retrospective asked all members their thoughts on how efficiently or well we as a team had done different aspects of the Agile process. This is not a rating on how effective we think these processes are in general, rather, it is a rating on how effective we as a team have been at carrying out these processes. This retro was created in the interest of making these Agile processes get done more efficiently/effectively.

As can be seen, there was a general consensus that we did well in how we conducted our meetings, how we divided up work and our team allocations. Additionally, there was a consensus that we started doing way better with our communication, making progress and sprints. There was an overall improvement in every category in comparison to the first retrospective. All of the averages for each category increased. Still, we agreed that there is still room for improvement when it comes to making progress and communicating.

To address these issues, we set up another retrospective to talk about what specifically we were doing right and wrong regarding these Agile practices and came across some valuable insights. For example, even with the improvements made from the last retrospective, we still lacked clarity in how to go about backend features which slowed down our ability to make progress. As you will find in the action items we created after this retro, we have decided to commit to a backend on local storage. After collecting everyone’s responses, we talked about what we could do to reinforce the rights and correct the wrongs and came up with these action items.

**Completed Action Items from Last Retrospective:**

*   We should look ahead maybe a bit more and communicate deadlines clearly
*   More meetings (daily meetings)
*   More slack participation
*   We should specify our goals more clearly
*   We should review of what we initially planned on and what we've actually accomplished

**Outstanding Action Items from Last Retrospective:**

*   Make sure there isn’t any app-breaking code in the pipeline every 2-3 days
*   We should have a clear index/glossary for files/functions/variables to explain what it does and how it interacts with the rest of the app

**Action Items from this Retrospective:**

*   We will talk more about UI design later
*   Our backend will stay on localstorage. Login will be there to help us sync data across different devices.
*   Make sure to push and pull often to not only the feature branch but also staging.
*   Make your own feature branches. If you have unmerged work on your dev branch, merge it with staging, fix bugs, and then make the feature branch.
