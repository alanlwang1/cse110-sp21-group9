## IV. Discussion Items

**New Items**
### Import/Export file feature
- Export should be changed, doesn’t really offer much in terms of use case 
  - Will general user really bother about it? 
  - Will user make sense of the json objects we’re throwing at them? 
- Sanat thought export meant export as in getting data in a mutable format like csv
  - E.g. get all bullets with some tag or something 
- More like a backup than an export, should brand it as such 
- No point to storing user info if theres no login 

### Settings page
- Not much a point to have a settings page with 2 options
- If we really want to have a settings page,
  - Can have one big section of text telling user how to use app 
    - Theory about bujo maybe?
   
### Next Steps
- Hit immediate deliverable deadline
- Will judge you on what you have now, not what you will have 
- Don’t think about future-proofing project right now 
- At the end of the day, it is an academic project 
- Whatever you put in application make sure its complete and makes sense to have 
- Should try to present what we’ve went through as best as possible in the video

### Roadmap
- Next steps: 
  - Get CRUD integrated completely
  - Testing on integration 
  - General styling 
- Nonessential
  - Settings page
  - Mini calendar
