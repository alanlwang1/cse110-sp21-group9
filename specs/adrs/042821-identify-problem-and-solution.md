## We needed to identify what the problem was we were solving and what the solution was for our project pitch
- We had no unified idea of the problem we wanted to solve
- We were somewhat creating a solution in this state.

## Decision Outcome
- Our problem was boiled down to: "A Physical Bujo has several limitations/inefficiencies that make it somewhat user-unfriendly" 
- Hence, our solution was boiled down to: "An electronic bujo that strives to get rid of the inefficiencies of the physical one".

## Reasoning
Given that our MVPs were based off of the core functionality of a physical bullet journal, it was identified by Daisuke that there was not much separating our electronic version from a physical version. Little annoyances such as having to flip around the pages of a physical bujo, having a limited space to write in, the time cost of drawing charts and tables to track continuous data, and the limited stylization a few pens can do could be mitigated in an electronic one. Given this, we figured we should design our bujo to at the very least be as easy to navigate as a physical one or easier, have 'infinite' space to write in, have easy tracker creation and updation functionality, and perhaps have some stylization options.
