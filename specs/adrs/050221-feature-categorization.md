## We have a list of features to implement but we haven't concretely figured out which we should work on first
We only have a limited amount of time to implement features. Hence, we must pick and choose the ones that would be best for users first. We've already decided on the MVPs so these features will be the ones we've decided aren't MVPs but are still important enough to implement.

## Options
1. Calendar display for plans/events
2. Migration of plans/events across multiple days
3. Filtering plans/events based on tags
4. Dashboard
5. Journal
6. Notes
7. Analysis of Month
8. Templates/Widgets
9. Log in
10. Messages
11. Styled Bujo Themes
12. Tutorial
13. Data Security
14. Paid Themes
15. Custom Macros

## Decisions

### Calendar display for plans/events
Decided as relevant and necessary. Being able to see a calendar is essential for planning purposes and having an interactive one available at all times should help with navigability tremendously.

### Migration of plans/events across multiple days
Decided as relevant and necessary. Users will likely not be able to complete some tasks on some days and they'll have to push that task to the next one. Manually doing that is a hassle so having functionality to automatically do this is not only easy to implement but also quite helpful. 

### Filtering plans/events based on tags
Decided as relevant and necessary. Organizing your plans and events with labels/tags should be helpful to a user. We're still not sure whether the tags ought to be queryable but even an arbitrary label set by the user should still help quite a bit.

### Dashboard
Decided as relevant and necessary. A Dashboard not only helps with customization but also navigability. It is also the core of the wireframe we are committed to using. 

### Journal
Decided as relevant and necessary. What's a bullet journal without the ability to actually journal? Enough said.

### Notes
Decided as relevant and necessary

### Analysis of Month
Decided as a feature that would make our bujo unique. This feature simply counts the number of tasks, projects, and other important metrics that helps a user see how productive they are/were for a specific month.

### Templates/Widgets
Decided as a feature that would make our bujo unique. This feature adds optional functionality and customizability with weather reports, habit trackers, and etc.

### Log-in
Decided as a unique feature. We're still not 100% sure on how to implement this but we were told by Sanat on the 5th of May that it is possible to implement rather easily. Hence, we would like to try our hand at it.

### Inspirational Messages
This feature is quite novel but ultimately is unnecessary to the bujo. We can think about adding it but only if we have the time.

### Styled themes
Decided as novel but ultimately unnecessary. We figured function was more important than form. Styled themes clearly are a part of form.

### Tutorial
Decided as novel but ultimately unnecessary. A tutorial would help users use the bujo in the most efficient way according to us as developers. However, we agreed that a user will probably be fine without us telling them what's the correct way to 'bujo'.

### Data Security
Decided as a no-go. Securing user's data using latest encryption standards has lots of technical unknowns and we do not have the time to fully explore this.

### Paid Themes
Decided as a no-go. We would have to take the time to implement a payment system and since we're not trying to actually sell this as a product, this would ultimately be unneeded.

### Custom Macros
Decided as a no-go. Most users are not so efficiency-oriented that they would actually bother to learn and use custom macros. Macros itself tend to be quite situational in automating specific, repetitive tasks but these automations could probably be done better by the features marked as necessary for the bujo anyway.
