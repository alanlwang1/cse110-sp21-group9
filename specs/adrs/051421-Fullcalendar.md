## We found a neat API that could help us implement calendar functionality but we're not sure whether it's an Academic Integrity Violation
Fullcalendar has so much functionality that it might actually just let us abstract away everything related to calendars and event bullets. If we're allowed to use it, it would speed up development significantly but it seems a little too easy...

## Decision Outcome
We will not be using Fullcalendar to implement our calendar functionality. Doing so would lead to an Academic Integrity violation and so to avoid such an outcome, we will not be using this API. 

## What to do next
We will need to reassess our development goals and strategy given we cannot use Fullcalendar to help us.
