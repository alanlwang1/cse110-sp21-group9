# API Layer Shenanigans
Status: Pending

Deciders: Evan, Daisuke

Date: 5/10/2021 @ 12:00AM

## We don't really have a well-determined spec when it comes to back-end design
As such, these API layer decisions will have been made post-hoc (if that's the correct use of the term.) based on what the deciders believed would be most convenient.

## Decisions made
1. Decided bullets will be class based in order to extend functionality
2. Decided that get function will return bullet objects rather than ids, since this seems like a less round about method.
