## Need to decide which features are the bare minimum that we need to implement
- We were tasked with creating a bullet journal. 
- We also wanted to know what was the most important features we had to have in this journal if we had only a week to actually implement it.

## Considered Options

### Planner Features
  An actual physical bullet journal is essentially a planner so an electronic one should also have planning features too.

### Grid you can customize/input stuff in
  A physical bullet journal at its core is just grid paper that you write bullets in. Hence, it becomes extremely customizalbe which this feature also strives to be.

### CRUD
A physical bullet journal has planning features so the corresponding CRUD functionality would be:
1. Create Dates
2. Add or Remove Bullets
3. Migration Capability
  
### Audio/Video Input
As an electronic bullet journal, we can put in digital media which includes audio and video. This is the one essential thing that we believed our bullet journal should have over a physical one.

### Typing Functionality/Handwriting
You should probably be able to write in your bujo. While typing is one way, perhaps a user might prefer to write things down by hand.

## Decisions
1. Everything except handwriting was an MVP

## Reasoning
The above options identified the brunt of what a physical bujo was able to do. There were little differences between an electronic bujo and a physical one but it was quite apparant that being able to write on a computer screen was less practical than on a piece of paper, hence that idea was scrapped.
